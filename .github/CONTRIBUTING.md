# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to proton! You rock!

Here are some smaller things to look out for when adding code to this repository

- To keep things clean and similar, make sure you read the [how to layer](https://github.com/dvcrn/proton/blob/master/HOW-TO-LAYER.md) document in how to structure your layer correctly.
- Most of the contributors use atom+parinfer to develop proton. Make sure that your code doesn't break Parinfer indentation and works even after Parinfer re-formatted your code.
